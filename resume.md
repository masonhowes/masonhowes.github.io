# Work Experience

## BlackByte Cyber Security, Richland WA - *Internship*
*[BlackByte Cyber Security][] - Cyber Security company based in Tri-Cities, Washington*

June 2021 - August 2021

>My position as an intern for BlackByte Cyber Security, a company established in 2015 that deals with the detection and identification of cyber threats within critical infrastructure environments across the United States, had me playing a supporting role in managing servers and other parcels that were brought to the warehouse, and offered the unique chance to job shadow the founder of the company.
>
>During my time interning for BlackByte Cyber Security, I had the opportunity to further my understanding of the programming language Python, and to learn the ins and outs of dealing with company inventory and the management of important packages. As the internship took place under the constraints of COVID regulations, I also had the opportunity to take part in remote Zoom meetings, and was able to learn more about the process of distributing different tasks to company members.


## Trader Joe's, Seattle WA - *Crew Member*
*[Trader Joes][]*

June 2023 - Present

>My position as a crew member at Trader Joe’s has taught me valuable lessons about time management and quality customer service. In this job, I’ve learned how to work nearly every section of the store (including closing each area), as well as how to achieve the highest level of customer satisfaction possible.
>
>Being a member of the crew during active schooling quarters has also taught me how to discipline myself and keep on top of all of my work even when lacking sufficient time. With many students shopping, I’ve gained valuable experience working in heavy rush-hours as well as a generally busy atmosphere, familiarizing myself with the uncomfortable.
